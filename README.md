## Getting Started ##

The aDDM Toolbox library for C++ can be cloned on the user's machine or installed on a Docker container. For requirements for a local build of the aDDM Toolbox, see the __Local Requirements__. For instructions on the Docker installation, continue to the __Docker Build__ section. 

## Local Requirements ##

The standard build of the aDDM Toolbox assumes the Linux Ubuntu Distribution 22.04. This library requires g++ version 11.3.0, as well as three third-party C++ packages for thread pools, JSON processing, and statistical distributions:

* [BS::thread_pool](https://github.com/bshoshany/thread-pool)
* [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
* [Boost Math/Statistical Distributions](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/?view=category_math)

These dependencies can be installed using the following commands: 

```shell
$ wget -O /usr/include/c++/11/BS_thread_pool.hpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bshoshany/thread-pool/master/include/BS_thread_pool.hpp
$ mkdir -p /usr/include/c++/11/nlohmann
$ wget -O /usr/include/c++/11/nlohmann/json.hpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp
$ apt-get install libboost-math-dev libboost-math1.74-dev
```

Be sure to clone the aDDM Toolbox library from Github if you haven't done so already. 

*Note that the installation directory /usr/include/c++/11 may be modified to support newer versions of C++. In the event of a __Permission Denied__ error, precede the above commands with __sudo__.*

## Docker Build ## 

To install the dependencies and library using Docker, follow the steps below: 

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
* Start Docker Desktop. 
* Pull the Docker image, currently linked at `zenkavi/addm.cpp`. This can be done via terminal using: 
```shell
docker pull zenkavi/addm.cpp:0.0.1
```
* Go to your local Docker images and select __run__ on `zenkavi/addm.cpp`.
* Once the build is complete, you can interact with the library using the command line interface!

## Installation and Usage ## 

TThe aDDM-Toolbox-CPP library can then be built and installed in one step: 

```shell
$ make install
```

*In the event of a __Permission Denied__ error, precede the above command with __sudo__.*

This will install the libaddm.so shared library as well as the corresponding header files. Although there are multiple header files corresponding to the aDDM and DDM programs, simply adding `#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>` to a C++ program will include all necessary headers. A simple usage example is described below: 

`main.cpp`:
```C++
#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    aDDM addm = aDDM(0.005, 0.07, 0.5);
    std::cout << "d: " << addm.d << std::endl; 
    std::cout << "sigma: " << addm.sigma << std::endl; 
    std::cout << "theta: " << addm.theta << std::endl; 
}
```

When compiling any code using the toolbox, include the `-laddm` flag to link with the installed shared object library.

```
$ g++ -o main main.cpp -laddm
$ ./main
d: 0.005
sigma: 0.07
theta: 0.5
```

## Tutorial ##

In the [data](data/) directory, we have included two test files to demonstrate how to use the toolbox. [expdata.csv](data/expdata.csv) contains experimental data and [fixations.csv](data/fixations.csv) contains the corresponding fixation data. A description of how to fit models corresponding to these subjects is located in [tutorial.cpp](sample/tutorial.cpp). An executable version of this script can be build using the `make run` target. The contents of the tutorial are listed below, but can be found __verbatim__ in [tutorial.cpp](sample/tutorial.cpp).

`sample/tutorial.cpp`
```cpp
#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>
#include <iostream> 

int main() {
    // Load trial and fixation data
    std::map<int, std::vector<aDDMTrial>> data = loadDataFromCSV("data/expdata.csv", "data/fixations.csv");
    // Iterate through each SubjectID and its corresponding vector of trials. 
    for (const auto& [subjectID, trials] : data) {
        std::cout << subjectID << ": "; 
        // Compute the most optimal parameters to generate 
        MLEinfo info = aDDM::fitModelMLE(trials, {0.001, 0.002, 0.003}, {0.0875, 0.09, 0.0925}, {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}, {0}, "thread");
        std::cout << "d: " << info.optimal.d << " "; 
        std::cout << "sigma: " << info.optimal.sigma << " "; 
        std::cout << "theta: " << info.optimal.theta << std::endl;
    }
}  
```

Let's break this down piece by piece: 

```cpp
#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>
#include <iostream> 
```

This tells the C++ pre-processor to find the `addm` library and the main header file `cpp_toolbox.h`. The main header file includes all sub-headers for the `DDM` and `aDDM` classes and utility methods, so there is no need to include any other files. If you haven't already, run `make install` to install the `addm` library on your machine. This also tells the pre-processor to compile with the `<iostream>` library, which provides functionality for printing to the console. 

```cpp
// Load trial and fixation data
std::map<int, std::vector<aDDMTrial>> data = loadDataFromCSV("data/expdata.csv", "data/fixations.csv");
```

This uses the `loadDataFromCSV` function included in `util.h` to load the experimental data and fixation data from CSV files. Both files need to be structured in a specific format to be properly loaded. These formats are described below, with sample experimental data in `data/expdata.csv` and fixation data in `data/fixations.csv`. 

__Experimental Data__

| parcode | trial | rt | choice | valueLeft | valueRight |  
| :-:     | :-:   |:-: | :-:    | :-:       | :-:        | 
| 0       | 0     |1962| -1     | 15        | 0          | 
| 0       | 1     |873 | 1      | -15       | 5          |  
| 0       | 2     |1345| 1      | 10        | -5         |  

__Fixation Data__

| parcode | trial | fixItem | fixTime |
| :-:     | :-:   | :-:      | :-:      |
| 0       | 0     | 3        | 176      | 
| 0       | 0     | 0        | 42       | 
| 0       | 0     | 1        | 188      | 

Note that data can also be loaded from a single CSV as well. To do this, use the `loadDataFromSingleCSV` function. This format is described below: 

__Single CSV__

|  trial 	|choice |   rt	|  valueLeft 	|  valueRight 	|  fixItem 	|  fixTime 	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	        |:-:	        |:-:	    |:-:	    |
|   0	|  1 	|  350 	|   3	        |   0           |   0	    |   200	    |
|   0	|   1	|  350 	|   3	        |   0	        |   1	    |   150	    |
|   1	|   -1	|  400 	|   4	        |  5            |   0	    |   300	    |
|   1	|   -1	|  400 	|   4	        |   5	        |   2	    |   100	    |

The `loadDataFromCSV` function returns a `std::map<int, std::vector<aDDMTrial>>`. This is a mapping from subjectIDs to their corresponding list of trials. A single trial (choice, response time, fixations) is represented in the `aDDMTrial` object. 

```cpp
for (const auto& [subjectID, trials] : data) ...
```

Iterate through each individual subjectID and its list of aDDMTrials. 

```cpp
std::cout << subjectID << ": "; 
// Compute the most optimal parameters to generate 
MLEinfo info = aDDM::fitModelMLE(trials, {0.001, 0.002, 0.003}, {0.0875, 0.09, 0.0925}, {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}, {0, 0.5}, "thread");
std::cout << "d: " << info.optimal.d << " "; 
std::cout << "sigma: " << info.optimal.sigma << " "; 
std::cout << "theta: " << info.optimal.theta << std::endl; 
```

Perform model fitting via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to find the optimal parameters for each subject. The arguments for this function are as follows: 

* `trials` - The list of trials for the given subjectID. 
* `{0.001, 0.002, 0.003}` - Range to test for the drift rate (d).
* `{0.0875, 0.09, 0.0925}` - Range to test for noise (sigma).
* `{0.1, 0.3, 0.5}` - Range to test for the fixation discount (theta).
* `{0}` - Range to test for additive fixation factor (k). The default aDDM model assumes no additive scalar for fixations. 
* `"thread"` - indicates whether to use the standard or multithreaded implementation. Must be selected between `"basic"` and `"thread"`. 

When building the tutorial with `make run`, an executable will be created at `bin/tutorial`. Running this executable should print the model parameters for each subject. At first, it may seem like most subjecs report similar parameters. This is to be expected; however, there should be a slight variance among parameters for some subjects. The expected output is described below: 

```
0: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.0925 theta: 0.1
1: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.09 theta: 0.1
2: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.0875 theta: 0.1
3: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.09 theta: 0.1

## Modifying the Toolbox ## 

Some users may want to modify this codebase for their own purposes. Below are some examples of what users may want to do and some tips on altering the code. 

### Alternative Optimization Algorithms ###

For some use-cases, MLE may not be optimal for model fitting. So, some users may want to change how the model fitting algorithm identifies the optimal parameters. The portion of the `fitModelMLE` function in the aDDM class where MLE is actually performed is highlighted in the `addm.cpp` file, but is also described below. 

```cpp
double minNLL = __DBL_MAX__; 
aDDM optimal = aDDM(); 
for (aDDM addm : potentialModels) {
    ProbabilityData aux = NLLcomputer(addm);
    if (normalizePosteriors) {
        allTrialLikelihoods.insert({addm, aux});
        posteriors.insert({addm, 1 / numModels});
    } else {
        posteriors.insert({addm, aux.NLL});
    }
    if (aux.NLL < minNLL) {
        minNLL = aux.NLL; 
        optimal = addm; 
    }
}
```

Key Variables: 
* `potentialModels`: Vector of all possible aDDM models and is created by iterating through the entire parameter grid-space. 
* `posteriors`: Mapping from individual aDDM models to their NLL or marginalized posteriors, depending on input conditions. If the marginal posteriors are to be computed, these calculations are performed at the end of computations. 
* `allTrialLikelihoods`: Mapping from individual aDDM models to their computed `ProbabilityData` objects. For reference, this object contains information regarding the computed proabilities for a vector of `aDDMTrial` objects. It is comprised of the sum of Negative Log Likelihoods, sum of likelihoods, and a list of all likelihoods for each trial. 
* `optimal`: The most optimal model to fit the given trials. 

When redesigning this segment of code, the minimum requirement is that some `aDDM` object is selected as the __optimal__ model. All other computational features can be determined by the user. The decision to compute the marginal posteriors or include code to add to the mappings can also be determined by the user if they inted on using that feature. The code should still compile and run if the `posteriors` and `allTrialLikelihoods` maps are left empty. 

### Adding Parameters and Alternative Likelihood Calculators ###

Some users may want to fit models that have different parameters than those built into the standard model. Steps to use this toolbox with these modifications are described below. An example using a custom toolbox design is described in [custom.cpp](sample/custom.cpp) as well.  

__Adding New Parameters__: The `aDDM` class has a built-in field `optionalParameters` that allows users to easily add different parameters to a model. This field is a mapping from strings to floats, so named parameters can be mapped to their specific values. See example below: 

```cpp
#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    aDDM addm = aDDM(0.001, 0.02, 0.3);
    addm.addParameter("W", 5);
    std::cout << "W = " << addm["W"] << std::endl; 
}
```
Output: 
```
W = 5
```

__Alternative Likelihood Calculators__: The `aDDM` class also contains a starter method, `getLikelihoodAlternative`, for users who want to define their own likelihood computations using custom variables. A very simple example is provided in the function now, simply returning `1 / this->optionalParams["W"]`. This function should be updated depending on the user's chosen parameters and needs for the calculations. A good starting point could be copying the existing code in `getTrialLikelihood` to `getLikelihoodAlternative` and modifying it to their needs. Or, for users who know their own likelihood function will be similar to the existing `getTrialLikelihood` function, it may be more worth it to just modify that code instead. An example of a call to `getLikelihoodAlternative` is described below and in `sample/custom.cpp`:

`alternative.cpp`:
```cpp
double aDDM::getLikelihoodAlternative(aDDMTrial trial, int timeStep, float approxStateStep) {
    // EXAMPLE CODE! 
    try {
        return 1 / this->optionalParams["W"];
    } catch (exception e) {
        return 1; 
    }
}
```
Function call:
```cpp
#include <addm/cpp_toolbox.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    aDDM addm = aDDM(0.001, 0.02, 0.3);
    addm.addParameter("W", 5);
    double likelihood = addm.getLikelihoodAlternative(aDDMTrial()); 
    std::cout << "Likelihood = " << likelihood << std::endl;     
}
```
Output: 
```
Likelihood = 0.2
```

__Custom Model Fitting__: These two features can be combined to fit models using any number of parameters and a custom likelihood calculator. To do so, follow the below steps and example or see `sample/custom.cpp`: 

1. Fill in `getLikelihoodAlternative` in `alternative.cpp`. It may be useful to start by copying `getTrialLikelihood` and modifying it as needed. 
```cpp
double aDDM::getLikelihoodAlternative(aDDMTrial trial, int timeStep, float approxStateStep) {
    return (this->optionalParams["A"] + this->optionalParams["B"] + this->optionalParams["C"]) / 10;
}
```
2. Define a range for custom parameters. This involves defining a mapping from different parameters (in their string form) to a vector of numbers of potential values. For example, 
```cpp
std::map<string, vector<float>> rangeOptional = {
    {"A", {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}}, 
    {"B", {0.5, 0.6, 0.7}}, 
    {"C", {0.8, 0.9}}
};
```
3. Load trials as usual and call `aDDM::fitModelMLE` to perform model fitting and retrieve the most optimal model. Be sure to toggle the last two arguments of the function as necessary, which specify if `getLikelihoodAlternative` should be used and if there exists potential values for custom parameters to test all combinations of. (These parameters should be __true__ and __rangeOptional__ if the custom parameter space is non-empty). 
```cpp
std::vector<aDDMTrial> trials = aDDMTrial::loadTrialsFromCSV(SIMS);
MLEinfo info = aDDM::fitModelMLE(
    trials, {0.005}, {0.07}, {0.5}, {0}, "thread", false, 1, 0, 10, 0.1, {0}, {0}, true, rangeOptional);
```

Note that C++ requires positional arguments, so there is no way to get around filling in all arguments up to the ones you intend to modify from the default. Some users may prefer to use Python instead of C++ to allow for keyword arguments, which may be filled in and changed from the default at the users will. See the Python Bindings section below for more details on getting started with Python Bindings. 

*See `addm.h` for complete documentation on model fitting arguments.*

## Python Bindings ## 

Python bindings are also provided for users who prefer to work with a Python codebase over C++. The provided bindings are located in [lib/bindings.cpp](lib/bindings.cpp). Note that [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and Python version 3.10 (at a minimum) are __strict__ prerequisites for installation and usage of the Python code. These can be installed with 

```shell
apt-get install python3.10
pip3 install pybind11
```

Once `pybind11` and Python3.10 are installed, the module can be built with:

```
make pybind
```

This will create a shared library object in the repository's root directory containing the `addm_toolbox_cpp` module. Although function calls remain largely analogous with the original C++ code, an example is described below that can be used to ensure the code is working properly: 

`main.py`: 

```Python
import addm_toolbox_cpp

ddm = addm_toolbox_cpp.DDM(0.005, 0.07)
print(f"d = {ddm.d}")
print(f"sigma = {ddm.sigma}")

trial = ddm.simulateTrial(3, 7, 10, 540)
print(f"RT = {trial.RT}")
print(f"choice = {trial.choice}")
```
To run the code: 
```
$ python3 main.py
d = 0.005
sigma = 0.07
RT = 850
choice = 1
```

Model fitting for the aDDM is largely analgous to the original C++ code. We provide a Python model of [sample/tutorial.cpp](sample/tutorial.cpp) below: 

`tutorial.py`
```Python
import addm_toolbox_cpp

data = addm_toolbox_cpp.loadDataFromCSV(
    "data/expdata.csv", "data/fixations.csv")

for subject_id, trials in data.items(): 
    info = addm_toolbox_cpp.aDDM.fitModelMLE(
        trials, 
        rangeD=[0.001, 0.002, 0.003], 
        rangeSigma=[0.0875, 0.09, 0.0925],
        rangeTheta=[0.1, 0.3, 0.5], 
        computeMethod="thread"
    )

    print(f"{subject_id}: " + 
          f"d: {round(info.optimal.d, 4)} " + 
          f"sigma: {round(info.optimal.sigma, 4)} " +
          f"theta: {round(info.optimal.theta, 4)}")
```
To run the code: 
```
$ python3 tutorial.py
0: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.0925 theta: 0.1
1: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.09 theta: 0.1
2: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.0875 theta: 0.1
3: d: 0.001 sigma: 0.09 theta: 0.1
â‹®
```

Note that when executing any Python files using the `addm_toolbox_cpp` module, the compiled shared libary (`.so`) should be either: 

* Placed in the same directory as the Python executable. 
* Placed in some directory in the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable. (i.e. `usr/lib/python3.10` for Linux).

### Optional: Python Syntax Highlighting ###

For users working in a user interface, such as Visual Studio Code, a Python stub is provided to facilitate features including syntax highlighting, type-hinting, auto-complete. Although the `addm_toolbox_cpp.pyi` stub is built-in, the file can be dynamically generated using the [mypy stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html) tool. The `mypy` module can be installed using: 

```shell
pip install mypy
```

For users who plan to modify the library for their own use and want the provided features, the stub file can be built as follows: 

```shell
stubgen -m addm_toolbox_cpp -o .
```
*Note that the `pybind11` shared library file should be built before running `stubgen`.*

## Data Analysis Scripts ##

A set of data analysis and visualization tools are provided in the [analysis](analysis/) directory. Current provided scripts include: 

* DDM Heatmaps for MLE. 
* aDDM Heatmap for MLE. 
* Posterior Pair Plots.
* Time vs RDV for individual trial.
* Value Differences against Response Time Frequencies. 

See the individual file documentation for usage instructions.
